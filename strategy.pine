Can you build a strategy script with this two indicators?
I need it to require the following in order to enter a position:
LONG POSITION:
• The latest bot alert needs to be a BUY signal.
• The color of the heikin ashi candles needs to be green.
• The price must have gone inside the heikin ashi candle, tested and respected it, closing above said heikin ashi candle.
• The entry price should be set to the closing price of the last candle.

SHORT POSITION:
• The latest bot alert needs to be a SELL signal.
• The color of the heikin ashi candles needs to be red.
• The price must have gone inside the heikin ashi candle, tested and respected it, closing below said heikin ashi candle.
• The entry price should be set to the closing price of the last candle.
